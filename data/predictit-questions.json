    "description": "The winning contract shall be that which identifies the candidate, between Andrés Arauz and Guillermo Lasso, who wins a larger percentage of the popular vote in the 2021 Ecuadorian presidential runoff election, and the difference in the percentages of the popular vote won by these two candidates. Percentages of the popular vote shall be determined by dividing the number of votes won by each candidate over the total number of votes for the two candidates officially reported. Blank (blancos) or spoiled (nulos) ballots are excluded from these calculations.\nIn the event of a tie in the percentage of the popular vote won by the two party candidates, the contract \"Arauz, less than 1%\" shall resolve to Yes. Should the result fall precisely on the threshold between two contracts, this market will resolve to the contract with the higher numerical range.\nPredictIt reserves the right to wait for further official, party, judicial or other relevant announcements, reports or decisions to resolve any ambiguity or uncertainty before the market is settled. Markets may stay open or incur a delay in settlement well past the date of the contest in certain circumstances. If there is any change to an event, or any situation arises, that is not in PredictIt’s view addressed adequately by the market rules, PredictIt will decide the fairest and most appropriate course of action.\nPredictIt’s decisions and determinations under this rule shall be at PredictIt’s sole discretion and shall be final.\n",
