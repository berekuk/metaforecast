This question will resolve when the light-blue line (\"no measures\") rises at 45 or more in the \"7 days average\" version of the graph.\nIf OxCGRT's primary dataset stops reporting these data before the question resolves, Hypermind might rely on other sources it deems most reliable and relevant to settle the question, for example OxCGRT's [secondary dataset](https://github.com/OxCGRT/USA-covid-policy) on USA subnational data, or another source that reports a statistic comparable to OxCGRT's current concept of \"no measures for workplace closures.\" If no such source is available, this question might be suspended without ever being resolved.\n*For this question, \"no measures for workplace closures\" will correspond to a 0 for the \"C2_Workplace closing\" variable, as described in the dataset's [codebook](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md). For this question to resolve, it must be the case that for 7 days in a row, the \"C2_Workplace closing\" variable is set to 0 for at least 45 U.S. states (the STATE_TOTAL jurisdictions) or 44 U.S. states and Washington D.C..\n",
